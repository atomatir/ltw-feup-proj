This project was made for the LTW class at FEUP. It's main purpose was for us to learn how a website works behind the scenes.
  
  The website is an AirBnB style website made with pure PHP, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3 and SQLite. Users can add places for people to rent or search for places.

  To run the website you have to enable **SQLite PDO** on your php.init. Then run:
  ```bash
  php -S <ip>:<port>
  ``` 

  Where **ip** and **port** is the ip adress and port of the website.
